# Conversational Chatbot using Groq API


This GitHub repository contains a Streamlit-based application, which enables user engagement with a conversationally proficient chatbot, powered by the LangChain API. The application incorporates the Groq API to generate responses and preserves a record of the conversation, thereby offering contextual insight for the chatbot's replies.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversational Experience**: The application offers a platform for users to engage in a two way conversation with the chatbot, where they can pose questions, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

- **Context-aware Responses**: The application keeps a record of the conversation(History), enabling the chatbot to provide responses that are informed by the context of the conversation's history.
- **LangChain-powered Chatbot**: The chatbot is driven by the LangChain API, which leverages sophisticated natural language processing techniques to produce responses that mimic human-like conversation.

## Usage
To use this application, it is necessary to have Streamlit and the additional required Python libraries installed. Also, a Groq API key is needed, which can be acquired by registering on the Groq website. Upon obtaining all necessary requirements, the application can be executed by running the script through Streamlit:

```shell
streamlit run Conversational_chatbot.py
```
This will start the chatbot in the Streamlit server and launch the application in your web browser."# Conversational-Chatbot-using-Groq-API"
